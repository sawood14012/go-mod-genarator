It allows unbounded resource usage via HTTP and RPC services.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they arent very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet\u2019s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter A\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter B or some number of occurrences of the letter C (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a D\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesnt take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e /A(B|C+)+D/.test(ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD)\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e /A(B|C+)+D/.test(ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX)\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn\u2019t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLets look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: ACCCX. While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three Cs:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesnt match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of Cs | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 Cs, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/hashicorp/nomad/command/agent` to version 0.10.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/7002)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/7022)\n"], "cvss_scores": [7.5], "snyk_cve_ids": ["CVE-2020-7218"], "modified_date": ["20201105"], "title": ["Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"], "snyk_ecosystem": ["golang"], "malicious": [false], "snyk_cvss_v3": ["CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"], "vuln_commit_date_rules": ["<#2020-01-30T18:38:25Z"], "package_name": ["github.com/hashicorp/nomad/command/agent"], "fixed_in": ["0.10.3"], "snyk_vuln_id": ["SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMHASHICORPNOMADCOMMANDAGENT-564510"], "snyk_pvt_vulnerability": [false], "module_name": ["github.com/hashicorp/nomad"], "exploit": ["Not Defined"], "patch_exists": [""], "fixable": [true], "versions": ["0.9.6", "0.7.0", "0.9.5", "0.9.4-rc1", "0.9.2-rc1", "0.8.4", "0.7.1-rc1", "0.7.0-rc1", "0.5.5", "0.5.2", "0.5.0", "0.4.0", "0.9.0-rc2", "0.10.2", "0.10.0-rc1", "0.8.4-rc1", "0.5.0-rc1", "0.2.3", "0.8.5", "0.5.1", "0.10.0-beta1", "0.9.2", "0.9.1-rc1", "0.9.0-rc1", "0.9.0-beta1", "0.8.7-rc1", "0.8.2", "0.7.0-rc2", "0.5.5-rc2", "0.5.1-rc2", "0.3.0-rc2", "0.10.0-connect1", "0.9.3", "0.9.0-beta3", "0.5.2-rc1", "0.2.1", "0.9.7", "0.8.7", "0.9.1", "0.8.1", "0.8.0-rc1", "0.6.0-rc1", "0.5.6", "0.4.1", "0.2.3-rc1", "0.2.2", "0.2.0", "0.10.2-rc1", "0.9.0-beta2", "0.7.1", "0.7.0-rc3", "0.6.0", "0.5.5-rc1", "0.5.4", "0.5.3", "0.5.3-rc1", "0.5.0-rc2", "0.4.3", "0.4.0-rc1", "0.3.1", "0.7.1-rc1+ent", "0.9.4", "0.3.2", "0.10.0", "0.6.2", "0.5.6-rc1", "0.7.1-rc1+pro", "0.3rc1", "0.4.2", "0.4.0-rc2", "0.3.2-rc1", "0.1.2", "show", "0.0.0", "0.8.0", "0.6.3", "0.6.0-rc2", "0.3.0", "0.1.1", "0.10.1", "0.9.0", "0.8.6", "0.8.3", "0.7.0-beta1", "0.6.3-rc1", "0.6.1", "0.5.1-rc1", "0.4.1-rc1", "0.3.2-rc2", "0.1.0"]}, {"severity": ["medium"], "snyk_url": ["https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMOPENCONTAINERSRUNCLIBCONTAINER-50017"], "references": ["GitHub Commit:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/5d93fed3d27f1e2bab58bad13b180a7a81d0b378", "NVD:https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-9962", "Redhat Security Advisory:https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/cve-2016-9962", "Seclists Full Disclosure:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jan/29"], "snyk_cwes": ["CWE-200"], "vertex_label": ["SCVE"], "description": ["## Overview\nAffected version of [`github.com/opencontainers/libcontainer`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) are vulnerable to Information Exposure.\nRunC allowed additional container processes via runc exec to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.

Traversal of directories is possible due to no sanitization.\n\n## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with dot-dot-slash (../) sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/goadesign/goa` to version 3.0.9, 2.0.10, 1.4.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/commit/70b5a199d0f813d74423993832c424e1fc73fb39)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2388)\n"], "cvss_scores": [7.5], "modified_date": ["20201105"], "title": ["Directory Traversal"], "snyk_ecosystem": ["golang"], "malicious": [false], "snyk_cvss_v3": ["CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C"], "vuln_commit_date_rules": ["<#2019-12-04T22:34:09Z"], "package_name": ["github.com/goadesign/goa"], "fixed_in": ["1.4.3", "2.0.10", "3.0.9"], "snyk_vuln_id": ["SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGOADESIGNGOA-536317"], "snyk_pvt_vulnerability": [true], "module_name": ["github.com/goadesign/goa"], "exploit": ["Unproven"], "patch_exists": [""], "fixable": [true], "versions": ["1.4.2", "1.0.0", "2.0.7", "2.0.3", "3.0.3", "3.0.2", "2.0.0", "2.0.4", "1.4.0", "3.0.5", "1.4.1", "1.2.1", "1.3.0", "2.0.5", "1.1.0", "2.0.8", "3.0.6", "3.0.8", "1.2.0", "3.0.1", "3.0.4", "3.0.7", "1.3.1", "3.0.0"]}, {"severity": ["high"], "snyk_url": ["https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMMIEKGDNS-50059"], "references": ["GitHub Commit:https://github.com/miekg/dns/commit/43913f2f4fbd7dcff930b8a809e709591e4dd79e", "GitHub Issue:https://github.com/miekg/dns/issues/627", "GitHub PR:https://github.com/miekg/dns/pull/631"], "snyk_cwes": ["CWE-400"], "vertex_label": ["SCVE"], "description": ["## Overview\nAffected versions of [`github.com/miekg/dns`](https://github.com/miekg/dns) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS.

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser\u2019s Same Origin Policy.\r\n\r\n\u05bfInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they\u2019ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r\n \r\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r\n\r\n### Types of attacks\r\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r\n\r\n|Type|Origin|Description|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user\u2019s browser.| \r\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user\u2019s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup.
