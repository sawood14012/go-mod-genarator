(dot dot) in the embedded layer data in an image.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with dot-dot-slash (../) sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\r\n\r\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\r\n\r\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\r\n\r\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\r\n```\r\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\r\n\r\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \r\n\r\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\r\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-7569)\r\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/appc/docker2aci/issues/201)\r\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/appc/docker2aci/commit/2ab8826d6957d97ed64e5e29a484af6370eae2e1)\r\n- [GitHub Changelog](https://github.com/appc/docker2aci/releases/tag/v0.13.0)\r\n- [Openwall](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/28/2)"], "cvss_scores": [5.5], "snyk_cve_ids": ["CVE-2016-7569"], "modified_date": ["20201105"], "title": ["Directory Traversal"], "snyk_ecosystem": ["golang"], "malicious": [false], "snyk_cvss_v3": ["CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"], "vuln_commit_date_rules": [">=#2016-02-24T12:57:26Z&<#2016-10-14T14:06:00Z"], "package_name": ["github.com/appc/docker2aci/lib"], "fixed_in": ["0.13.0"], "snyk_vuln_id": ["SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMAPPCDOCKER2ACILIB-50031"], "snyk_pvt_vulnerability": [false], "module_name": ["github.com/appc/docker2aci"], "exploit": ["Not Defined"], "patch_exists": [""], "fixable": [true], "versions": ["0.11.0", "0.12.2", "0.12.0", "0.9.1", "0.10.0", "0.12.1", "0.9.3", "0.9.2", "0.9.0", "0.12.3", "0.11.1"]}, {"severity": ["high"], "snyk_url": ["https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMDOCKERDOCKER-50001"], "references": ["GitHub Commit:https://github.com/docker/docker/commit/707ef9618b3b26a0534a0af732a22f159eccfaa5", "RedHat Security Advisory:http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0820.html"], "snyk_cwes": ["CWE-264"], "vertex_label": ["SCVE"], "description": ["## Overview\r\nAffected version of [`github.com/docker/docker`](https://github.com/docker/docker) are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation.\r\nDocker 1.0.0 uses world-readable and world-writable permissions on the management socket, which allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3499)\r\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/docker/docker/commit/707ef9618b3b26a0534a0af732a22f159eccfaa5)\r\n- [Redhad Security Advisory](http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0820.html)"], "cvss_scores": [8.4], "snyk_cve_ids": ["CVE-2014-3499"], "modified_date": ["20201105"], "title": ["Privilege Escalation"], "snyk_ecosystem": ["golang"], "malicious": [false], "snyk_cvss_v3": ["CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"], "vuln_commit_date_rules": [">=#2014-06-08T23:42:30Z&<#2014-06-19T20:02:21Z"], "package_name": ["github.com/docker/docker"], "fixed_in": ["1.0.1"], "snyk_vuln_id": ["SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMDOCKERDOCKER-50001"], "snyk_pvt_vulnerability": [false], "module_name": ["github.com/docker/docker"], "exploit": ["Not Defined"], "patch_exists": [""], "fixable": [true], "versions": ["upstream/0.1.1", "docs-v1.12.0-rc4-2016-07-15", "0.8.0", "0.6.3", "0.1.5", "0.1.4", "1.0.0", "0.12.0", "0.7.5", "0.7.0-rc3", "0.7.0-rc1", "0.3.2", "0.1.3", "0.11.1", "0.7.6", "0.7.0-rc4", "0.7.0-rc2", "0.4.6", "xdocs-v1.10-28-mar-2016", "docs-v1.12.0-2016-08-09", "docs-v1.12.0-2016-07-29", "0.5.2", "0.10.0", "0.7.0-rc5", "0.6.5", "0.4.2", "0.7.4", "0.4.7", "0.9.1", "0.9.0", "0.7.2", "0.6.6", "0.6.4", "0.6.1", "0.5.1", "0.5.0", "0.4.1", "0.4.0", "0.3.0", "0.1.7", "docs-v1.12.1-2016-08-12", "upstream/0.1.3", "upstream/0.1.2", "upstream/0.1.4", "0.7.0", "0.6.2", "0.2.1", "0.11.0", "0.4.5", "0.7.0-rc7", "0.4.3", "0.2.2", "0.1.6", "0.1.1", "0.4.4", "0.3.3", "0.2.0", "0.7.3", "0.7.0-rc6", "0.6.0", "0.1.2", "docs-v1.11.2-2016-06-10", "xdocs-v1.10-09-05-2016", "builder/1", "builder/2", "0.8.1", "0.4.8", "0.3.1", "0.1.8", "0.1.0", "docs-v1.12.0-2016-07-28", "0.0.3", "docs-v1.12.0-2016-08-03", "autorun/1", "debian/0.1.1-1", "docs-v1.12.0-2016-08-03.1", "0.6.7", "0.7.1", "0.5.3", "0.3.4"]}, {"severity": ["medium"], "snyk_url": ["https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMMAISTRAISTIOOPERATORPKGCONTROLLER-770790"], "references": ["GitHub PR:https://github.com/maistra/istio-operator/pull/462", "RedHat Bugzilla Bug:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1850380"], "snyk_cwes": ["CWE-200"], "vertex_label": ["SCVE"], "description": ["## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure.

An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r\n\r\n### Affected environments\r\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r\n\r\n* Web servers\r\n* Application servers\r\n* Web application environments\r\n\r\n### How to prevent\r\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r\n\r\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r\n* Redirect invalid requests.\r\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\r\n\r\n## Remediation\r\nUpgrade `github.com/grafana/grafana` to version 5.2.0-beta1 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/11813)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v5.2.0-beta1)\n"], "cvss_scores": [6.1], "snyk_cve_ids": ["CVE-2018-12099"], "modified_date": ["20201104"], "title": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"], "snyk_ecosystem": ["golang"], "malicious": [false], "snyk_cvss_v3": ["CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"], "vuln_commit_date_rules": ["<#2018-05-08T09:28:16Z"], "package_name": ["github.com/grafana/grafana"], "fixed_in": ["5.2.0-beta1"], "snyk_vuln_id": ["SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGRAFANAGRAFANA-72290"], "snyk_pvt_vulnerability": [false], "module_name": ["github.com/grafana/grafana"], "exploit": ["Not Defined"], "patch_exists": [""], "fixable": [true], "versions": ["1.5.0", "1.1.0", "4.6.5", "4.1.0", "3.0.4", "3.0.0-beta6", "4.6.1", "4.0.0", "list", "1.8.0-rc1", "3.0-beta1", "5.0.0-beta1", "4.3.1", "packages@6.3.0-alpha.36", "1.8.1", "1.3.0", "5.0.0-beta5", "4.1.0-beta1", "5.1.1", "4.5.2", "4.2.0", "4.2.0-beta1", "5.1.3", "4.6.3", "4.6.0-beta2", "4.6.0-beta1", "2.6.0-beta1", "5.1.0", "4.1.1", "4.0.2", "4.0.0-beta1", "3.1.1", "3.1.0", "3.1.0-beta1", "2.1.3", "2.0.1", "1.0.1", "omgtest", "1.9.0", "packages@6.3.0-alpha.33", "5.1.4", "5.1.0-beta1", "5.0.3", "5.0.0", "4.5.0", "4.4.2", "4.0.0-beta2", "5.0.2", "5.0.0-beta4", "5.0.0-beta2", "4.6.0-beta3", "4.5.1", "4.3.0", "3.0.0-beta7", "2.1.2", "5.0.0-beta3", "4.4.1", "2.6.0", "5.0.4", "4.4.0", "2.1.1", "2.0.2", "1.8.0", "4.6.4", "4.3.0-beta1", "2.5.0", "2.0.0-beta3", "5.0.1", "4.6.0", "4.4.3", "dupa", "test", "1.4.0", "3.0-beta3", "1.6.1", "1.5.1", "1.7.0-rc1", "packages@6.3.0-beta.1", "1.7.0", "1.0", "3.0-beta2", "1.9.0-rc1", "1.5.2", "1.2.0", "1.6.0", "1.0.3", "1.5.3", "5.,2.4", "1.0.4", "4.5.0-beta1", "3.0.3", "2.0.0-beta1", "3.0-beta4", "test-new-release-pipeline", "1.0.2", "1.5.4", "5.1.5", "4.6.2", "3.0.2", "5.1.2", "4.3.2", "4.1.2", "4.0.1", "3.0.1", "2.1.0", "3.0-beta5", "1.9.1"]}, {"severity": ["medium"], "snyk_url": ["https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOM99DESIGNSAWSVAULTSERVER-568165"], "references": ["AWS Vault Release Notes:https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/releases/tag/v5.4.4", "GitHub Commit:https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/commit/ae369037cc75150edef7fbb7799933b48fcc1183", "GitHub Issue:https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/issues/578%23issuecomment-623921862", "GitHub Issue:https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/issues/578", "GitHub PR:https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/pull/580"], "snyk_cwes": ["CWE-350"], "vertex_label": ["SCVE"], "description": ["## Overview\n[github.com/99designs/aws-vault/server](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) is a vault for securely storing and accessing AWS credentials in development environments.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to DNS Rebinding.
